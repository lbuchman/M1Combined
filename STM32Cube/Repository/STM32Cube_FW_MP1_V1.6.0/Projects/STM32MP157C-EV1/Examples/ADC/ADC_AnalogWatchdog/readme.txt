@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC peripheral to perform conversions with an analog watchdog 
and out-of-window interrupts enabled.

Other peripherals related to ADC are used:
Mandatory:
 - GPIO peripheral is used in analog mode to drive signal from device pin to
   ADC input.
Optionally:
 - Timer peripheral is used to trigger ADC conversions.
 - DMA peripheral is used to transfer ADC converted data.

ADC settings:
 - Regular group:
   Conversions are triggered by external event (timer at 1kHz).
 - Continuous mode is disabled (and sequencer disabled: only 1 channel selected) to yield only 1 conversion at each conversion trigger.
 - Analog watchdog 1 is enabled, minimum and maximum thresholds are respectively set 
   to 1/8 and 5/8 of full range scale (between about 0.36V and 1.81V with full range of 2.9V).

ADC conversion results:
 - ADC conversions results are transferred automatically by DMA, into variable
   array "aADCxConvertedData".
 - DMA and ADC are configured to operate continuously, in circular mode.
   When DMA transfer half-buffer and full buffer lengths are reached, callbacks
   HAL_ADC_ConvHalfCpltCallback() and HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback() are called.

Board settings:
 - ADC is configured to convert ADC_CHANNEL_16 (pin PA.04).
 - Channel configured on regular group:
   The voltage input on ADC channel is provided from DAC channel.
   ADC and DAC channel have been chosen to have the same pad shared at device level: pin PA.04.
   ==> Therefore, there is no external connection needed to run this example.
 - Voltage is increasing at each click on User push-button, from 0V to maximum range (Vdda) in 5 steps
   (with vdda=2.9V: 0V, 0.7V, 1.45V, 2.1V, 2.9V), then starting back from 0V.
   Note: Initial voltage value is Vdda/2.

To observe voltage level applied on ADC channel through GPIO, connect a voltmeter on
pin PA4 (pin 1 on JP11).

STM32MP157C-EV1 board LED is used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED4 is turned-on/off in function of ADC conversion result.
    - Turned-off if voltage into of AWD window
    - Turned-on if voltage is out of AWD window
 - Error: In case of error, LED4 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.


@note In case of noise on voltage applied on ADC channel input (due to connectors and wires parasitics),
      ADC analog watchdog may trig at a voltage level with an uncertainty of tens of mV.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

  - This example runs on STM32MP1XX devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32MP157C-EV1 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

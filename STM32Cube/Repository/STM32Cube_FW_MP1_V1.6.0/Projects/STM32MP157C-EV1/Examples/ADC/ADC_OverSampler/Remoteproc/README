@par Description of M4 Cube example with Linux Remote Processor Framework

When Cube firmware is running on Cortex-M4, System Clock tree and regulators(vrefbuf) are configured by Cortex-A7
Besides, clock source for each peripheral assigned to Cortex-M4 is done by Cortex-A7.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work with Linux running on Cortex-A7, you must do the following :
Before running M4 Cube example, you have to
1) interrupt uboot
2) choose the right configuration to make sure that M4 resources are assigned to Linux Resource Manager driver

Then,
 - Start example using the following command: "fw_cortex_m4.sh start" under example directory installed in userfs partition
     * it will load and start firmware using Linux Remote Processor
 - Stop example using the following command: "fw_cortex_m4.sh stop" under example directory installed in userfs partition
     * it will stop firmware using Linux Remote Processor

@par Example Description
This example describes how to configure and use the ADC to convert an external
analog input combined with oversampling feature to increase resolution through the HAL API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32MP1xx Devices :

The ADC is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_16 (pin PA.04)
while the oversampler is enabled. 
Oversampling ratio is set to 1024 so the maximum output result 
is 0xFFF * 1024 = 0x3FFC00 (22 bits). Result is 6-bit right shift.

uwConvertedValue variable contains the 16-bit conversion result and 
uwInputVoltage yields the input voltage in mV. 

The converted value is monitored through debugger: uwConvertedValue and uwInputVoltage variables.

STM32 board LED can be used to monitor the conversion:
  - LED4 is ON when there is no error.
  - LED4 blinks when there is an error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

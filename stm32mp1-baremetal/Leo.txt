1. Partition SD card
Make sure to use good adapter
#cd /home/lenel/stm32mp1-baremetal
#scripts/partition-sdcard.sh

2. Build
make sure there is no any errors

#cd /home/lenel/stm32mp1-baremetal/bootloaders/mp1-boot/
#make

3. Load to SD-Card
#make load

make sure to put correct device, 99% it will be /dev/sdb
check the device with dmesg
make sure the tranfer rate is less then 10MB/S, if transfer rate is greater
then the data is written to file, not to sd-disk

4. Run terminal
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0

5. To use debugger
I do not know how to initialize MP1 to not secure mode from GDB, so it is not working directly, but there is a work around with Sd-Card
Make sure to run MP1-boot from SD-Card
MP1 boot runs from RAM, not DDR
start openocd
#sudo openocd -f board/stm32mp15x_dk2.cfg  -c "gdb_flash_program enable"

start ddd
 ddd build/fsbl.elf --debugger arm-none-eabi-gdb
 
 From DDD gdp command line run
 target extended-remote localhost:3333
 
 The debugger will break.
 Since MP1-Boot is in the main loop, you code will be in the main loop
 
cd ~/STMicroelectronics/STM32Cube/STM32CubeProgrammer/Drivers//rules/
sudo cp 50-usb-conf.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=usb1 -d fsbl.stm32  0x1 -s 0x1

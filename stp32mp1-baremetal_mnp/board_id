Hi Leo,

Good catchâ€¦ 
I neglected to bump the ID REV bits to REV D for the M1 V3 with RMII 50Mhz OSC.
The present M1 V3 is at REV C

[PCB_ID5:PCB_ID3] =>  000      (M1 V3)

[PCB_ID2:PCB_ID0] =>  011      (REV D)

(Refer to ID BIT DEFINITION Table on page 20 of schematics)

Schematics updated.

Any questions let me know.

Thanks,
Tom
